# Description

This repository is an example of techniques to employ in `PlantUML`

I only have the example of `skins` and multiple diagrams in a single `.puml` file.

There is more to document on how to use this effectively in `Visual Studio Code` using the excellent `PlantUML` extension from `Jebbs`
